Difference with openai_ros
==========================

This package was build upon the structure of the `openai_ros <http://wiki.ros.org/openai_ros>`_ package that was created by `the construct <https://www.theconstructsim.com/>`. As a result commits made before `3df2ec4d7f446bd7a4b5280d3435278b1e5e3c11 <https://github.com/rickstaa/ros-gazebo-gym/commit/3df2ec4d7f446bd7a4b5280d3435278b1e5e3c11>`_ are
licensed under a `IGPL <https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License>`_ license. All the code changes I created after this commit are licensed under a
`MIT <https://github.com/rickstaa/ros-gazebo-gym/blob/noetic/LICENSE>` license. I use the MIT license since it is less restrictive and therefore improves OpenSource collaboration.
