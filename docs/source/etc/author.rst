The ROS Gazebo Gym framework is developed and maintained by the `Cognitive Robotics department`_
of the `TU Delft`_. It was created out of a Master Thesis of `Rick Staa`_ under the supervision of
`dr. Wei Pan`_. It was created for testing the RL algorithms found in the
`bayesian-learning-control <https://github.com/rickstaa/bayesian-learning-control>`_ package on
the `Franka Emika Panda`_ robot.
